# Verification Assignment

This assignment will help you get familiar with how to model simple network functionality in first-order logic and use the [Z3 theoram prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) to automatically reason about it.

## Obtaining required software

### Python3

You need Python3 to be able to run this exericse.

### Z3 Theorem Prover

Install Z3 and its python wrapper by following the instructions on its [github repository](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3):

- You will need to provide a special flag when building Z3 to be able to use the python wrapper.
- The python wrapper itself can be installed using `pip`.


## Warmup

The file `warmup.py` contains three examples, increasing in complexity, to help familiarize you with how to express what you want to analyze in logic and use Z3's python API to reason about it. 

## Reasoning about forwarding behavior
